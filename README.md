# Effective Java Notes

This is a repository that I will share my notes as I read Effective Java. I am using the 3rd Edition of Effective Java. The book consists of 90 Items in total. I try to do my best to share at least an Item a week.

# Repo Structure

## Items

Every *chapter* will have its own directory and the **"Items"** will be located under each chapter.


## Keywords

**"Keywords"** directories contain somewhat related topics to each chapter. It is something that I made up to take some notes on the concepts that I wanted to learn and remember later on.

# Contribution

All contributions are welcome. This repository is open for anyone who wants to correct any misunderstandings, add new perspectives and fixes.
