# Effective Java Notes

This is a repository that I will share my notes as I read Effective Java.

Each chapter will have its own directory and the "Items" will be located under related chapter.

"Keywords" directories contain somewhat related topics to each chapter. It is something that I made up to take some notes on the concepts that I wanted to learn and remember later on.
