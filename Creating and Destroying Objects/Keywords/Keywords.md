*Flyweight Pattern* - This pattern suggests that you stop storing the unique state inside the object. Instead, you should pass this state to specific methods which rely on it. Only the identical state stays within the object, letting you reuse it in different contexts. As a result, youâ€™d need fewer of these objects since they only differ in the intrinsic state, which has much fewer variations than the extrinsic.

*Immutable class* - Once an object is created, we cannot change its content. In Java, all the wrapper classes (like String, Boolean, Byte, Short) and String class is immutable. The easiest way to create an immutable class in **Java** is by declaring all the fields private and final and not providing setters.

*Thread safety* - Thread safety implies multiple threads can write/read data in same object without memory inconsistency errors. This means that different threads can access the same resources without exposing erroneous behavior or producing unpredictable results.
